  - A GUI app that can stream a VM (like a YouTube video; download parts of the disk as required)
- VMNetFS (`vmnetfs`)
  - FUSE filesystem used for VMNetX for disk streaming

  - https://github.com/gt-ospo/vmnetx.git

  - [FUSE](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/filesystems/fuse.html) is a kernel API that allows implementing filesystems through a userspace process (i.e. without editing the kernel source or loading a kernel module)
  - VMNetFS and Caviar uses this to provide on-demand disk streaming for VMs
- GTK
  - Popular GUI toolkit/library for Linux/BSD/etc; does not have mature support for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS
