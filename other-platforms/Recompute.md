# Recompute

Dates: 
- Initial release: 2009
- Last Updated: 2012


Overview: 
- Developed as a research reproducibility framework to preserve computational experiments.​
- Captures complete software environments in virtual machines. This is so that research results can be recreated just as originally computed.​
- In other words, the core idea was to archive research code and data in a ready-to-run VM image to allow anyone to recompute the results in the future.​
- Built on `VirtualBox​`
- Encapsulates code, dependencies, and system configurations.​
