# Comparison of EaaSI and Olive Archive 

| **Dimension**                | **EaaSI (Yale University)** | **Olive Archive (CMU)** |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Architecture**             | Built on the Emulation-as-a-Service (EaaS) framework (originally developed by the bwFLA team) with Yale’s enhancements. EaaSI deploys a client–server web architecture, integrating multiple emulator engines under a unified system [Source](https://eaasi.info/). It features a redesigned web client by PortalMedia for interacting with emulated environments [Source](https://portalmedia.com/eaasi). | Employs a hybrid client–server architecture using virtual machines. Legacy software (and its OS) is encapsulated in a full **VM** image, delivered from a standard web server and executed via the VMNetX client using KVM/QEMU [Source](https://olivearchive.org/technology/). A click on the web portal launches the VM on an “edge” node (user’s machine or nearby server), with the VM state demand-paged over HTTP for efficiency [Source](https://cs.cmu.edu/olive). |
| **Supported File Types**     | Accepts a broad range of digital formats through attached media in emulation. EaaSI can import **disk images** (floppy, optical ISO, or hard disk formats like IMG, DMG, QCOW, VDI, VMDK, etc.) and even arbitrary file sets (which get packaged into a mountable ISO) for use within an emulator [Source](https://eaasi.info/documentation). The system’s “Universal Virtual Interactor” can match files to appropriate legacy software environments, enabling one-click opening of files in the correct original application [Source](https://eaasi.info/resources). | Not limited by specific file formats – Olive preserves entire executable **environments**. Any software application or interactive content (e.g. games, scientific tools) can be archived inside a VM with its dependencies [Source](https://olivearchive.org/about). The Olive collection contains 1980s–90s games and software spanning Apple II, MS-DOS, classic Mac, and Windows (even Microsoft Office 4.3), each stored as a ready-to-run VM image [Source](https://olivearchive.org/collection). |
| **Emulation Capabilities**   | Supports a wide **range of computing platforms** via integrated emulators. The underlying EaaS toolkit includes ~8 different emulator engines covering ~15 legacy platforms (from Mac 68K System 7, PowerPC Mac OS, to various DOS/Windows and Unix variants) [Source](https://eaasi.info/). Users can run these environments in-browser with high fidelity to original behavior (multiple emulator instances accessible through one web interface) [Source](https://eaasi.info/resources). | Can **recreate numerous vintage environments** in full fidelity. As of 2018, Olive packaged at least 17 distinct virtual machines running legacy operating systems and applications [Source](https://cs.cmu.edu/olive). The experience “in every way matches” running the original software on original hardware [Source](https://olivearchive.org/). Olive can even nest hardware emulation inside a VM if needed – for example, an archived Mac System 7 environment includes a 68K CPU emulator (Basilisk II) running on an x86 host [Source](https://olivearchive.org/about). |
| **Scalability**              | Designed to **scale out** via a network of distributed nodes. Each institution can run its own EaaSI instance (“node”), and the system facilitates sharing of prepared environments between nodes [Source](https://eaasi.info/). This federated model means no single server bears the entire load, and additional nodes or computing resources can be added to handle growth. | Leverages a **distributed execution** model to scale. Olive offloads computing to the user side: the archive provides VM images over standard web protocols, and each user’s VMNetX client handles the heavy execution on their own machine (or a nearby “cloudlet”) [Source](https://cs.cmu.edu/olive). This approach reduces server load (the Olive server mainly serves files, no specialized infrastructure needed beyond a web server). |
| **User Interface**           | Provides a **web-based UI** aimed at simplicity for preservationists. Through the EaaSI portal, users can create, configure, search, and launch emulated environments all in the browser [Source](https://eaasi.info/documentation). The interface (developed with PortalMedia) was designed to be intuitive, reducing the expertise needed to run emulations. | Offers **one-click access** to archived software via a web portal. After installing the Olive client, a user simply selects an application from the Olive website and clicks “Launch” – the system then automatically streams and starts the virtual machine [Source](https://olivearchive.org/technology). |
| **Accessibility**           | Primarily available to member institutions and their users. EaaSI is implemented as a **distributed service** that libraries/archives deploy for their communities (the platform itself is open-source and was grant-funded) [Source](https://eaasi.info/). A public demonstration sandbox (with open-source software environments) is hosted by Yale and SPN for practitioners to experiment. However, access to many preserved software titles is restricted to authorized users due to copyright [Source](https://eaasi.info/resources). | Currently **limited to collaborators** because of licensing concerns. The Olive archive’s preserved VMs (which contain proprietary OS and software) are, for legal reasons, only accessible to approved research partners as of now [Source](https://olivearchive.org/about). The Olive software itself (client and planned server) is open source (GPLv2) [Source](https://cs.cmu.edu/olive). |
| **Funding Sources**         | Supported by major grants and institutional backing. Yale’s EaaSI project has received funding from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, as well as support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services [Source](https://eaasi.info/). | Initially funded through research grants and university support. The Olive project was backed by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and IMLS in its development phase. It originated at Carnegie Mellon University with collaboration between the CS department and University Libraries [Source](https://olivearchive.org/). |
| **Preservation Approach**   | **Emulation-based preservation**: EaaSI preserves the original computing environments needed to access digital content, rather than converting the content itself. It curates operating systems, software, and configured environments with rich metadata [Source](https://eaasi.info/resources). | **Environment encapsulation**: Olive “freezes” the exact software environment in a VM, creating a time-capsule that can be reopened indefinitely without needing original hardware or OS installation [Source](https://olivearchive.org/technology). |
| **Integration & Interoperability** | Built with interoperability in mind. EaaSI uses **open standards and APIs** – for example, it leverages metadata standards like PREMIS, CodeMeta, and **Wikidata** to describe software and environments, which makes these records portable and integrable with other catalog systems [Source](https://eaasi.info/resources). | Emphasizes compatibility through standard tech. Olive’s approach relies on widely used components: disk images are served via plain **HTTP** and the virtualization uses open-source KVM/QEMU [Source](https://olivearchive.org/about). |
| **Deployment Model**        | **Distributed & self-hosted**: EaaSI is typically deployed by each participating institution on its own servers (on-premise or cloud) [Source](https://eaasi.info/documentation). | **Hybrid client–cloud**: The Olive archive is hosted at CMU as a central web service (housing the library of VM images), while execution is split between server and client [Source](https://olivearchive.org/technology). |
| **Legal & Licensing**       | Must adhere to **copyright restrictions** on legacy software. EaaSI doesn’t provide broad public access to proprietary software or OS images; instead, it operates under a framework of library use and preservation exceptions [Source](https://eaasi.info/legal). | Constrained by **software licensing** of the archived content. Olive packages commercial operating systems and applications (e.g. Windows, Office, games), so it cannot lawfully distribute these to everyone [Source](https://olivearchive.org/about). |
