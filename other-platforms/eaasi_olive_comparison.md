# Comparison of EaaSI and Olive Archive 

| **Dimension**                | **EaaSI (Yale University)** | **Olive Archive (CMU)** |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Architecture**             | Emulation-as-a-Service (EaaS) framework with Yale. EaaSI deploys a client–server web architecture, integrating multiple emulator engines. It has a web client for interacting with emulated environments. | Uses a hybrid client–server architecture using virtual machines. Legacy software (and its OS) is encapsulated in a full VM image, delivered from a standard web server and executed via the VMNetX client using KVM/QEMU. A click on the web portal launches the VM on an “edge” node (user’s machine or nearby server), with the VM state demand-paged over HTTP for efficiency. |
| **Supported File Types**     | Accepts a large range of digital formats through attached media in emulation. EaaSI can import disk images (floppy, optical ISO, or hard disk formats like IMG, DMG, QCOW, VDI, VMDK, etc.) and even arbitrary file sets (which get packaged into a mountable ISO) for use within an emulator. The system’s “Universal Virtual Interactor” can match files to appropriate legacy software environments, enabling one-click opening of files in the correct original applications. | Not limited by specific file formats. Olive preserves entire executable environments. Any software application or interactive content (for example games, scientific tools) can be archived inside a VM with its dependencies. The Olive collection contains games and software spanning Apple II, MS-DOS, classic Mac, and Windows, each stored as a ready to run VM image. |
| **Emulation Capabilities**   | Supports a lot of computing platforms via integrated emulators. The underlying EaaS toolkit includes many different emulator engines which cover different legacy platforms from Mac 68K System 7, PowerPC Mac OS, to various DOS/Windows and Unix variants. Users can run these environments in-browser with high fidelity to original behavior (multiple emulator instances accessible through one web interface). | Can recreate numerous vintage environments in full fidelity. The experience matches running the original software on original hardware. Olive can even nest hardware emulation inside a VM if needed. For example, an archived Mac System 7 environment includes a 68K CPU emulator (Basilisk II) running on an x86 host. |
| **Scalability**              | Designed to scale out via a network of distributed nodes. Each institution can run its own EaaSI instance (“node”), and the system allows sharing of prepared environments between nodes. This federated model means no single server bears the entire load, and additional nodes or computing resources can be added to handle growth. | Leverages a distributed execution model to scale. Olive offloads computing to the user side: the archive provides VM images over standard web protocols, and each user’s VMNetX client handles the heavy execution on their own machine. This approach reduces server load (the Olive server mainly serves files, no specialized infrastructure needed beyond a web server). |
| **User Interface**           | Provides a web-based UI aimed at simplicity for preservationists. Through the EaaSI portal, users can create, configure, search, and launch emulated environments all in the browser. | Offers one-click access to archived software via a web portal. After installing the Olive client, a user simply selects an application from the Olive website and clicks “Launch” – the system then automatically streams and starts the virtual machine. |
| **Accessibility**           | Primarily available to member institutions and their users. EaaSI is implemented as a distributed service that libraries/archives deploy for their communities (the platform itself is open-source and was grant-funded). A public demonstration sandbox (with open-source software environments) is hosted by Yale for experiemnt. | Currently limited to collaborators because of licensing concerns. The Olive archive’s preserved VMs (which contain proprietary OS and software) are, for legal reasons, only accessible to approved research partners as of now [Source](https://olivearchive.org/about). The Olive software itself (client and planned server) is open source (GPLv2) [Source](https://cs.cmu.edu/olive). |
| **Integration & Interoperability** | EaaSI uses open standards and APIs – for example, it uses metadata standards like PREMIS, CodeMeta, and Wikidata to describe software and environments, which makes these records portable and integrable with other catalog systems. | Emphasizes compatibility through standard tech. Olive’s approach relies on widely used components: disk images are served via plain HTTP and the virtualization uses open-source KVM/QEMU. |
