## FAQs

### What do users want to preserve?
- Old software programs and applications like a word processor or a video game from decades ago.​
- Digital files in proprietary or obsolete formats, along with the software needed to read them (a vintage CAD drawing and the CAD software that can display it).​
- Operating systems and computing environments, to retain the look and feel and context in which digital content was originally used.​
- Things like classic video games, interactive educational CD-ROMs, early websites – essentially, content that has historical or research value and was created on now-obsolete platforms ​
- Scientific computations and workflows, here the interest is in preserving the exact computational experiment environment so results can be validated later.

### Do users care about performance? ​
- Depends on the scenario: ​
1. Interactive experience preservation: playing an old game via emulation, the user expects it to be responsive. Modern power usually makes matching original speed easy. ​
2. If rerunning an old scientific code, it might run slower under emulation/virtualization. But if the purpose is verification or museum demonstration, a slower run is acceptable. As long as it completes in a reasonable time, performance is not the primary concern.​
- Overall, with new hardware, even computationally heavy preservation tasks are feasible, and users prioritize faithfulness over speed.​
