## Problem
The problem that this tutorial will solve is the need to add software onto our base EaaSi environment. ​Software resources can normally be added to 
environments as an externally mounted drive​. Unfortunately, this does not work for Lubuntu as adding software to a Lubuntu environment seems to not do anything. For this reason,
this tutorial demonstrates the currently best known work around method for uploading software resources to EaaSi. 

## Constraints
With this method, the maximum allowed size for an upload is 2.6MB. The team is currently working on finding methods to increase this uload size. However, for now, files larger than this size will need to be split into multiple chunks and uploaded seperately. 

### Step 1
Log into EaaSi.
