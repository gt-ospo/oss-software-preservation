# Contributing to these resources

Thank you for your interest in contributing to these open source training resources. We appreciate your interest and contributions. Please review these guidelines for the project so that you can most effectively engage with the developers and maintainers of the project. 

The license for the project itself is MIT (for any included code samples). Please review related resources for their specific license requirements.  

## Types of Contributions Accepted

There are several opportunities for contributions in the areas of new features, training and education, and general improvements to the codebase. We will generally post suggestions for new contributions as issues to the repository itself. 

### Contribution Process

In general, to contribute fixes or new code to this repository, you would do the following:
1) Fork the repository under your username.
2) Make your changes and run any unit tests (if they exist) locally to see that changes do not break anything
3) Open a PR and fill in the PR template with relevant information on your changes.
4) Request reviewers and discuss/update the PR until it is ready to be accepted.

### Reporting Bugs

**NOTE**: If you find a security vulnerability in the codebase, please do not open an issue. Email the primary maintainers or post a Discussion message noting you have something you'd like to report. This provides the development team an opportunity to respond to your findings and prepare a patch that can be released to mitigate any vulnerabilities.

Other general bugs can be reported using a general issue form.

### Suggesting Features or Enhancements

If there is a feature that you would like to see in this training that doesn't currently exist, we appreciate your contribution via an issue. We will look to add issue templates in the near future. 

## Code review process

We will aim to review your PR in 1-2 weeks with a goal of getting it merged within that time frame. If added changes are needed, we will follow up via the PR request and may make some suggestions to help your PR pass the CI unit tests (if applicable) and be able to be merged into the main line of the codebase. 

### Code style conventions

There are no specific guidelines for code formatting but please try to be consistent with the existing codebase with your changes. 

## Community Channels for Discussion

The primary discussion channels for this project are via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gt-ospo/oss-software-preservation/issues). You are welcome to post any general questions about the project as an issue or by emailing the maintainers.
